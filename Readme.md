# Combine vs. RxSwift Performance Benchmark Test Suite ðŸ“Š
This project contains a benchmarking test suite for comparing the performance of the most commonly used components and operators in RxSwift and Combine. For a detailed comparison of RxSwift with Combine have a look at [our blog post](https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/?p=831).

The RxSwift performance benchmark tests are [the original ones used in the RxSwift project](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Tests/Benchmarks/Benchmarks.swift). We removed the two tests from RxCocoa testing Drivers, since there is no equivalent in Combine. The Combine tests are 1:1 translated tests from the Rx test-suite and should, therefore, be easily comparable.

**Important update:** As mentioned correctly the old numbers were created with XCTests running in DEBUG mode. The differences seem not so critical in Release builds. We have updated all the numbers and graphs to use release builds.

As a summary Combine was faster in every test and on average 41% more performant than RxSwift. These statistics show every test-method and its results. Lower is better.

## Test Results Summary

UPDATE 2: extra tests with concurrently used 

I have concluded my research on async-await performance in swift
Given:
- anObservable source that emits 10000 elements
- each emission gets independendly rescheduled via observe(on:)
- this source is combined with 2 more source into a combine latest
- the result is combined with 2 more source into a combine latest
- previous step 6 more times

Subscribing and waiting for all subscriptions to exhaust has produced the following results with different reimplementations of classic RxSwift:

**Test** | **Value (ms)** 
--- | ---
RxSwift (NSRecursiveLock), Concurrent Queue | 579 
RxSwift (NSRecursiveLock), Serial Queue | 114
Combine, Concurrent Queue | 133 
Combine, Serial Queue | 55
RxSwiftAwait (Actors as locks), Concurrent Task Scheduler | 13044
RxSwiftAwait (Actors as locks), Serialized non-recursive Task Scheduler | 110676
RxSwiftUnfair (os_unfair_lock), Concurrent Queue | 300
RxSwiftUnfair (os_unfair_lock), Serial Queue | 136
RxSwiftUnfair (os_unfair_lock), Concurrent Task Scheduler | 269
RxSwiftUnfair (os_unfair_lock), Serialized non-recursive Task Scheduler | 753

Conclusion:
- Combine wins
- structured concurrency is a perf improvement for Rx only in concurrent, massively parallel scenarios
- we need to write a compile-time-only RxSwift frontend for Combine

UPDATE: with Swfit async algo!

## Performance Test Example: PublishSubject Pumping

For every test we replace the RxSwift component with the corresponding Combine component. In this case `PublishSubject` with `PassthroughSubject`.

### RxSwift
```swift
func testPublishSubjectPumping() {
    measure {
        var sum = 0
        let subject = PublishSubject<Int>()

        let subscription = subject
            .subscribe(onNext: { x in
                sum += x
            })

        for _ in 0 ..< iterations * 100 {
            subject.on(.next(1))
        }

        subscription.dispose()

        XCTAssertEqual(sum, iterations * 100)
    }
}
```

### Combine
```swift
func testPublishSubjectPumping() {
    measure {
        var sum = 0
        let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

        let subscription = subject
            .sink(receiveValue: { x in
                sum += x
            })

        for _ in 0 ..< iterations * 100 {
            subject.send(1)
        }
        
        subscription.cancel()
        
        XCTAssertEqual(sum, iterations * 100)
    }
}
```
